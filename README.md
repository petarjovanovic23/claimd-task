# Exchangeagram

Web application built using Flutter serving as a challenge. App is a concept of a social media platform, which allows you to search for users that have Instagram(Exchangeagram) profiles. The name Exchangeagram is a reference to the movie 'The Internship'. Making this app totally different than IG!

## Application overview

Build using Dart&Flutter, the API was built using Node.js and the API documentation with Swagger UI. 
The backend part of this project is hosted to a different repository @ 'https://github.com/petarjovanovic23/backend-exchangeagram'.

Allows app user to search the instagram database and retrieve basic profile data. The search is done by instagram usernames. After the username was searched for the scraper script collects the data ands persists it to a MongoDB database. Thus, all the previously searched users will be shown within the app. Scraping was done using Node.js and Pupeeter. 

The app is very small and has very few functionalities thus the design itself is very simple and basic. 

Hope the app makes you laugh.
