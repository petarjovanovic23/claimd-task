# Exchangeagram

Web application built using Flutter serving as a challenge. App is a concept of a social media platform, which allows you to search for users that have Instagram(Exchangeagram) profiles. The name Exchangeagram is a reference to the movie 'The Internship'. Making this app totally different than IG!

## Application overview

Build using Dart&Flutter, the API was built using Node.js and the API documentation with Swagger UI. 
The backend part of this project is hosted to a different repository on my profile named '/ig-clone-node'.

The app is very small and has very few functionalities thus the design itself is very simple and basic. 

Hope the app makes you laugh.
